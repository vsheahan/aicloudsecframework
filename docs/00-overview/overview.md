# Framework Overview
This framework organizes work across six layers that align to real world attack paths.

1. **Identity and Secrets**: principals, tokens, API keys, workload identity, key management.
2. **Data and Retrieval**: source repositories, RAG corpora, governance of PII, PHI, PCI, and trade secrets.
3. **Model and Tooling**: model selection, fine-tuning, evals, tool and plugin security, function-calling boundaries.
4. **Agent Orchestration**: planners, memory stores, tool policies, environment isolation, rate and budget guards.
5. **Cloud Platform**: network segmentation, compute isolation, CNAPP controls, IaC hygiene, logging.
6. **Assurance and Operations**: evals, adversarial testing, incident response, monitoring, and governance.

## Outcomes
- Reduce prompt and tool misuse risk
- Prevent data exfiltration and supply chain compromise
- Provide audit ready evidence mapped to NIST, ISO, SOC 2

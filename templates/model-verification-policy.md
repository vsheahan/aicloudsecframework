# Model Verification Policy Template

**Control:** A4 - Supply Chain Integrity  
**Framework:** Agentic AI Cloud Security Framework  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** [Insert Date]

## Purpose

This policy establishes requirements for verifying the integrity and authenticity of machine learning model artifacts to ensure they have not been tampered with during storage, transmission, or deployment.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All machine learning models used in production environments
- Model artifacts sourced from internal teams or external providers
- CI/CD pipelines that deploy AI/ML models
- Model registries and artifact storage systems

## Policy Requirements

### 1. Cryptographic Verification

**Requirement:** All production model artifacts MUST have cryptographic verification using SHA-256 hashing and RSA digital signatures.

**Implementation:**
- Generate SHA-256 hashes for all model files
- Create cryptographically signed manifests using RSA-2048 or stronger
- Store verification keys securely with role-based access controls
- Verify both file integrity and signature authenticity before deployment

### 2. Automated Verification Pipeline

**Requirement:** Model verification MUST be automated and integrated into deployment pipelines.

**Implementation:**
- Trigger verification automatically when models are uploaded to storage
- Block deployment of models that fail verification
- Log all verification attempts and results for audit purposes
- Alert security teams on verification failures

### 3. Manifest Requirements

**Requirement:** All models MUST include standardized manifest files containing metadata and verification information.

**Manifest Contents:**
- Model name and version
- Creator/team information
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Complete file list with SHA-256 hashes
- Digital signature
- Dependencies and requirements
- Intended use case and limitations

### 4. Key Management

**Requirement:** Signing and verification keys MUST be managed according to cryptographic best practices.

**Implementation:**
- Use password-protected private keys for signing
- Store private keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services
- Distribute public keys through secure channels
- Implement key rotation procedures (minimum annually)
- Maintain key lifecycle documentation

### 5. Storage Security

**Requirement:** Model manifests and artifacts MUST be stored with appropriate security controls.

**Implementation:**
- Enable versioning on all model storage systems
- Encrypt storage at rest using AES-256 or equivalent
- Implement access logging and monitoring
- Use immutable storage where possible
- Regular backup and recovery testing

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Model Development Teams
- Generate signed manifests for all models before release
- Follow secure development practices
- Coordinate with security team for key distribution
- Document model provenance and dependencies

### Security Team
- Manage cryptographic keys and certificates
- Define verification infrastructure requirements
- Monitor and audit verification processes
- Investigate verification failures
- Maintain this policy and update as needed

### DevOps/Platform Teams
- Implement automated verification in CI/CD pipelines
- Configure and maintain verification infrastructure
- Monitor system health and performance
- Ensure proper logging and alerting

### Compliance Team
- Review verification processes for regulatory compliance
- Maintain evidence for audits
- Track policy exceptions and remediation
- Report on verification metrics

## Verification Workflow

### For Internal Models

1. **Development Phase:**
   - Complete model development and testing
   - Generate comprehensive manifest with all dependencies
   - Create SHA-256 hashes for all model artifacts

2. **Signing Phase:**
   - Use organization's private key to sign the manifest
   - Validate signature using corresponding public key
   - Store signed manifest alongside model artifacts

3. **Deployment Phase:**
   - Automated pipeline downloads model and manifest
   - Verify file integrity using SHA-256 hashes
   - Validate manifest signature using public key
   - Deploy only if verification passes

### For External Models

1. **Acquisition Phase:**
   - Obtain model artifacts from approved sources
   - Request or create verification manifest
   - Validate source authenticity and reputation

2. **Internal Verification:**
   - Generate internal hashes for received artifacts
   - Create secondary manifest signed with internal keys
   - Document source information and acquisition date

3. **Approval Process:**
   - Security team review of external model
   - Risk assessment and approval workflow
   - Addition to approved model registry

## Compliance and Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Percentage of models with valid verification
- Number of verification failures per month
- Time to detect and respond to verification issues
- Coverage of automated verification across pipelines

### Audit Requirements
- Quarterly review of verification processes
- Annual assessment of key management practices
- Documentation of all policy exceptions
- Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures

### Incident Response
- Immediate isolation of models failing verification
- Forensic analysis of verification failures
- Communication to affected teams and stakeholders
- Post-incident review and process improvement

## Technical Implementation Guide

### HashTraceAI Integration

**Recommended Tool:** HashTraceAI for cryptographic model verification

**Setup Requirements:**
```bash
# Install HashTraceAI
git clone https://github.com/vsheahan/hashtraceai.git
pip install -r hashtraceai/requirements.txt

# Generate encryption key pair
python3 cli.py keys --name production-models --out-dir keys/

# Generate signed manifest
python3 cli.py generate --path ./model-directory \
  --created-by "Security Team" \
  --model-name "Production-Model-v1" \
  --model-version "1.0" \
  --sign-key keys/production-models.pem

# Verify manifest and signature
python3 cli.py verify --manifest-file manifest.json \
  --public-key keys/production-models.pub
```

## Policy Exceptions

### Exception Criteria
Exceptions to this policy may be granted only for:

A comprehensive security framework for implementing controls in agentic AI cloud environments. This framework provides guidance, control catalogs, templates, and example configurations to help organizations secure AI agents and tools operating across cloud infrastructure.

## Why This Framework Exists

While security frameworks like NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001 provide excellent governance guidance, they leave a critical gap: **how do you actually implement AI security controls in production cloud environments?**

This framework bridges that gap by providing:

- **Production-ready infrastructure code** instead of high-level recommendations
- **AI-specific security controls** for agentic behavior, tool policies, and retrieval safety
- **Multi-cloud implementations** with consistent security across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **Automated validation** that proves controls work with built-in evidence collection
- **Standards alignment** mapping to ISO/IEC 42001, NIST frameworks, and SOC2

**The result:** Organizations get production-ready infrastructure with integrated security controls, automated evidence collection, and comprehensive compliance documentation.

## How Do I Actually Use This?

Think of this as a **security cookbook** for companies deploying AI agents in the cloud. Instead of starting from scratch, you get:

- **Expert guidance** you customize to your needs
- **Copy-paste templates** for policies and configurations  
- **Step-by-step checklists** with concrete examples
- **Compliance mappings** to show auditors

### Who Uses This Framework

**Companies deploying AI agents** who need to answer: "How do we make this secure and compliant?"

**Common scenarios:**
- **CTO**: Deploying AI chatbots on AWS, needs security checklist
- **Security Engineer**: Boss said "secure our AI agents" - uses A1-A6 controls as implementation guide
- **Compliance Officer**: Auditor asks "How do you secure AI workloads?" - points to NIST/ISO mappings
- **DevOps Team**: Needs Terraform examples for secure AI infrastructure

### Real Usage Pattern: AI Customer Service Agent

```bash
# 1. Clone and explore
git clone https://github.com/vsheahan/aicloudsecframework.git
cat docs/30-controls/controls-catalog.md  # Review A1-A6 controls

# 2. Copy templates and customize
cp templates/tool-policy.md customer-service-agent-policy.md
# Edit: Tool name, allowed actions, budget limits ($50/day)

# 3. Use cloud examples as starting point  
cat examples/aws-notes.md  # Copy Terraform egress rules
# Modify IP addresses/endpoints for your environment

# 4. Implement controls and collect evidence
# A1: Set up 15-minute IAM tokens
# A2: Configure per-session budgets
# A6: Deploy egress allow-lists
```

**Result:** Secure AI agent deployed faster than building security from scratch, with audit-ready documentation.

## What This Framework Provides

- **6 Core Security Controls (A1-A6)** mapped to industry standards (NIST, ISO 27001, SOC2)
- **Implementation Guidance** for AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **Evidence Templates** for compliance and audit requirements 
- **Policy Templates** for tool governance and risk management
- **Reference Architectures** for secure AI agent deployment

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Cloud account (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Basic understanding of IAM/identity management
- Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vsheahan/aicloudsecframework.git
   cd aicloudsecframework
   ```

2. **Choose your deployment approach:**
   - Review [Reference Architectures](docs/20-architectures/reference-architectures.md)
   - Select cloud-specific examples in `examples/`

3. **Start with the framework:**
   ```bash
   # Review the complete framework
   cat docs/index.md
   
   # Understand the controls
   cat docs/30-controls/controls-catalog.md
   ```

### 5-Minute Quickstart

1. **Pick an Architecture**: Review [reference architectures](docs/20-architectures/reference-architectures.md) and select one that matches your use case

2. **Implement Core Controls**: Start with controls A1-A6 from the [controls catalog](docs/30-controls/controls-catalog.md):
   - A1: Identity for Agents and Tools
   - A2: Tool Policy and Budget Guards  
   - A3: Retrieval Safety
   - A4: Supply Chain Integrity
   - A5: Observation and Forensics
   - A6: Egress and Cost Controls

3. **Configure Templates**: Copy and customize templates from `templates/`:
   ```bash
   cp templates/tool-policy.md my-agent-policy.md
   # Edit with your specific requirements
   ```

4. **Deploy Examples**: Use cloud-specific examples as starting points:
   ```bash
   # For AWS
   cat examples/aws-notes.md
   
   # For Azure  
   cat examples/azure-notes.md
   
   # For GCP
   cat examples/gcp-notes.md
   ```

5. **Validate and Document**: Run [assurance tests](docs/40-assurance/assurance.md) and capture evidence per control requirements

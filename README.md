- Multi cloud and hybrid patterns, with emphasis on AWS, Azure, and GCP

## Quick Start
- Start with `docs/00-overview/overview.md` for the framing.
- Use `docs/20-architectures/` for reference diagrams and deployment blueprints.
- Implement controls from `docs/30-controls/controls-catalog.md` and track status in `mappings/controls-matrix.csv`.

A comprehensive security framework for implementing controls in agentic AI cloud environments. This framework provides guidance, control catalogs, templates, and example configurations to help organizations secure AI agents and tools operating across cloud infrastructure.

##  What This Framework Provides

- **6 Core Security Controls (A1-A6)** mapped to industry standards (NIST, ISO 27001, SOC2)
- **Implementation Guidance** for AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **Evidence Templates** for compliance and audit requirements 
- **Policy Templates** for tool governance and risk management
- **Reference Architectures** for secure AI agent deployment

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Cloud account (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Basic understanding of IAM/identity management
- Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vsheahan/aicloudsecframework.git
   cd aicloudsecframework
   ```

2. **Choose your deployment approach:**
   - Review [Reference Architectures](docs/20-architectures/reference-architectures.md)
   - Select cloud-specific examples in `examples/`

3. **Start with the framework:**
   ```bash
   # Review the complete framework
   cat docs/index.md
   
   # Understand the controls
   cat docs/30-controls/controls-catalog.md
   ```

### 5-Minute Quickstart

1. **Pick an Architecture**: Review [reference architectures](docs/20-architectures/reference-architectures.md) and select one that matches your use case

2. **Implement Core Controls**: Start with controls A1-A6 from the [controls catalog](docs/30-controls/controls-catalog.md):
   - A1: Identity for Agents and Tools
   - A2: Tool Policy and Budget Guards  
   - A3: Retrieval Safety
   - A4: Supply Chain Integrity
   - A5: Observation and Forensics
   - A6: Egress and Cost Controls

3. **Configure Templates**: Copy and customize templates from `templates/`:
   ```bash
   cp templates/tool-policy.md my-agent-policy.md
   # Edit with your specific requirements
   ```

4. **Deploy Examples**: Use cloud-specific examples as starting points:
   ```bash
   # For AWS
   cat examples/aws-notes.md
   
   # For Azure  
   cat examples/azure-notes.md
   
   # For GCP
   cat examples/gcp-notes.md
   ```

5. **Validate and Document**: Run [assurance tests](docs/40-assurance/assurance.md) and capture evidence per control requirements
